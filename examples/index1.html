            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>It is a typical dish of Mexico varies widely depending on the area of the country where it is made. It is wheat tortillas stuffed and rolled immersed in hot sauce.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>500 ml Chicken Brotht</li>
                <li>1 chicken breast (1 whole or two half)</li>
                <li>1 slice cheddar cheese (150 g)</li>
                <li>1 small bunch cilantro</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cumin - ground</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper</li>
                <li>100 ml fraiche or fresh cream</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons green sauce - you buy made</li>
                <li>1 avocado</li>
                <li>4 Wheat Tortillas</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a saucepan that is not too large put to heat half the chicken broth. Meanwhile, grate the cheddar and chop the cilantro. When the broth comes to a boil, we put the chicken breast. I Chop into pieces to be done before. Once cooked chicken, using two forks or a knife and fork it desmenuzamos and reserve. Do not abhor the broth if you can perhaps use later.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees. We chop the garlic and put the butter in a skillet. When the butter has melted, add the garlic and fry over medium-high heat until they begin to brown. Add the flour and stir for approximately 30 seconds. We incorporate the remaining chicken broth, cumin, salt and pepper. We lower the heat to medium-low. If you overran a small amount of chicken broth you can use it here.</li>
                <li>When it begins to boil, add the sour cream and salsa verde. I recommend you add it slowly until it is to your taste spicy. Stir so that everything is integrated well and add the coriander, stir and return to it away from the fire.</li>
                <li>We put half the sauce into a baking dish. Peel and chop into small pieces avocado. We put on a tortilla chicken, avocado slices and grated cheese, do a roll and put it in the tray on the sauce. Do the same with the remaining tortillas, we cover with the remaining sauce and sprinkle grated cheese you have left us.</li>
                <li>Bake until gratin. We serve enchiladas putting dishes and, using a spoon, topped with the sauce.</li>
            </ol>
